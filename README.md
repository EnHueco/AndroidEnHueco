# Android EnHueco

### What is it?
[EnHueco] is an online system that allows university members (students and teachers) to share their weekly schedule information with other members of the community, so that they're able to plan work meetings, leisure time and any other activity together. 

This repository contains the Android mobile version of the platform. It allows Android users to connect to the system and use it either with data or offline.

### Tech

EnHueco (Android) uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Picasso] - a powerful image downloading and caching library for Android!
* [Android Week View] - an Android library to display calendars (week view or day view) within the app.
* [Rounded Image View] - a fast ImageView (and Drawable) that supports rounded corners.
* [QRGen] - QR code generation API for Java.
